Angelic Land Tenant Portal – Farmer Dashboard (Canada Agriculture UI)

Prompt Text:
Create a clean, friendly, and data-focused tenant portal dashboard for Angelic Land.
 Visual inspiration: use the same style and layout rhythm as Agrobe and Farm Management System UIs (soft panels, card-based metrics, rounded corners, left navigation sidebar).
 Keep Andjelic Land’s content tone (warm, real, Canadian farmland storytelling).
 The design must feel approachable for everyday farmers — simple, modern, but not overly futuristic.
